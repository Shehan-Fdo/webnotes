            <h2>Overview of Dot Matrix Printers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>An <strong>impact printer</strong> that creates output using a small <strong>matrix of
                        pins</strong>.</li>
                <li>Pins press against an <strong>ink ribbon</strong>, transferring ink to the paper to form characters
                    made of tiny <strong>dots</strong>.</li>
                <li>Ideal for environments requiring <strong>carbon copies</strong> or <strong>multi-part forms</strong>
                    due to the physical impact of the pins.</li>
                <li>Offers a <strong>low cost per page</strong>, making it economical for high-volume printing.</li>
                <li>Produces <strong>low-resolution output</strong>, unsuitable for high-quality or detailed prints.
                </li>
                <li>Operates <strong>noisily</strong>, making it impractical for quiet settings like libraries or
                    offices.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Print Head Mechanics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>print head</strong> moves <strong>back and forth</strong> across the page to create
                    output.</li>
                <li>Contains a <strong>matrix of small pins</strong> at the front, which strike the ribbon to transfer
                    ink.</li>
                <li>Equipped with a <strong>heat sink</strong> to dissipate heat generated during operation.</li>
                <li>Prints one line at a time; the paper advances after each pass to print the next line.</li>
                <li>Example: The print head moves horizontally while the paper moves vertically to cover the entire
                    page.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Printer Ribbon</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>ribbon</strong> is a single, continuous cartridge that spans the width of the page.</li>
                <li>Facilitates ink transfer as the print head moves back and forth across the ribbon.</li>
                <li>Designed as an <strong>unending loop</strong>, cycling through the cartridge until replacement is
                    needed.</li>
                <li>Replacement is <strong>quick and straightforward</strong>; cartridges are model-specific and must
                    match the printer’s make and model.</li>
                <li>Opening the ribbon cartridge reveals a long, folded ribbon stored compactly inside.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Paper Handling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Uses <strong>tractor feed</strong> mechanisms to pull paper through the printer.</li>
                <li>Paper has <strong>holes on the left and right sides</strong> (tractor feed holes) to align with the
                    printer’s feed mechanism.</li>
                <li>Misalignment of holes can cause <strong>paper jams</strong>; precise loading is essential.</li>
                <li>Common paper types include:<ul>
                        <li><strong>Continuous feed paper</strong>: Long, uninterrupted sheets, often perforated for
                            separation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Green bar paper</strong>: Historically used for printing source code or large
                            datasets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multi-part paper</strong>: Enables creation of multiple copies in a single pass
                            using impact printing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Perforations allow removal of tractor feed holes for a cleaner, standard-sized document.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Multi-Part Printing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Enables creation of <strong>multiple copies</strong> in a single print job using impact technology.
                </li>
                <li>Traditionally used <strong>carbon paper</strong> between sheets to create copies.</li>
                <li>Modern multi-part paper uses <strong>microencapsulated ink</strong> on the back of the first sheet,
                    reacting with clay on subsequent sheets to produce copies.</li>
                <li>Can cause <strong>skin irritation</strong> due to chemicals in the ink and clay; alternatives like
                    printing separate copies are often preferred.</li>
                <li>Cost-effective for specific use cases but declining in popularity due to complexity and health
                    concerns.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Use Cases and Limitations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary use cases:<ul>
                        <li>Printing <strong>carbon copies</strong> or <strong>multi-part forms</strong> (e.g.,
                            invoices, receipts).</li>
                        <li>High-volume printing where <strong>cost efficiency</strong> is prioritized over quality.
                        </li>
                        <li>Legacy systems or niche applications where impact printing is required.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Limitations:<ul>
                        <li><strong>Low resolution</strong>: Output consists of visible dots, unsuitable for detailed or
                            professional documents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Noise</strong>: Loud operation makes it unsuitable for quiet environments.</li>
                        <li>Declining relevance: Replaced by modern printers (e.g., laser, inkjet) in most home and
                            business settings.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
