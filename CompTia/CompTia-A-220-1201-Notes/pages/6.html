            <h2>Purpose of This Lesson</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This lesson provides foundational knowledge of <strong>IP (Internet Protocol)</strong> and
                    networking concepts, which are essential for understanding <strong>Domain 2 (Networking)</strong> of
                    the A+ exam.</li>
                <li>If you are unfamiliar with networking basics, especially <strong>IP</strong>, this lesson serves as
                    a primer for more advanced topics covered later.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overview of Modern Networks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Modern networks are designed to transfer information between devices using various methods,
                    including <strong>Ethernet</strong>, <strong>wireless</strong>, and <strong>DSL</strong>.</li>
                <li>From an <strong>IP</strong> perspective, the physical transport method (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi) is
                    less important than the content of the <strong>packets</strong> being transmitted.</li>
                <li>Networks can be visualized as a series of <strong>highways or roads</strong>, where
                    <strong>IP</strong> acts as the <strong>truck</strong> carrying data across the network.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Encapsulation and Decapsulation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encapsulation</strong> is the process of nesting data within multiple layers of protocols
                    for transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>Decapsulation</strong> is the reverse process, where data is unpacked layer by layer upon
                    arrival.</li>
                <li>Example of data transmission to a web server:<ul>
                        <li>A <strong>client device</strong> (e.g., laptop) sends data to a <strong>web server</strong>
                            over an <strong>Ethernet network</strong>.</li>
                        <li>The data is wrapped in an <strong>Ethernet frame</strong>, which includes a
                            <strong>header</strong> (start of data) and a <strong>trailer</strong> (end of data).
                        </li>
                        <li>Inside the Ethernet frame is an <strong>IP payload</strong> with its own <strong>IP
                                header</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Within the IP payload is a <strong>TCP payload</strong> (or <strong>UDP payload</strong>)
                            with a <strong>TCP header</strong>.</li>
                        <li>For web traffic, the TCP payload contains <strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
                                Protocol)</strong> data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Internet Protocol (IP)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IP (Internet Protocol)</strong> is the primary protocol for data transmission across
                    networks.</li>
                <li>It acts as the <strong>transport mechanism</strong> (the "truck") that carries data between devices.
                </li>
                <li>Within IP packets, two key transport protocols are commonly used:<ul>
                        <li><strong>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>TCP is a <strong>connection-oriented</strong> protocol, meaning it establishes a formal connection
                    before data transfer and formally closes it afterward.</li>
                <li>Analogy: TCP works like a phone call, where both parties greet each other before talking and say
                    goodbye before hanging up.</li>
                <li>Key features of TCP:<ul>
                        <li><strong>Reliable delivery</strong>: Uses acknowledgments to confirm data receipt. If data is
                            lost or corrupted, the receiver requests a retransmission.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flow control</strong>: The receiver can request the sender to speed up or slow down
                            data transmission based on its capacity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Error recovery</strong>: Detects and corrects errors during transmission.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>TCP is often referred to as an <strong>OSI Layer 4 protocol</strong> (though the OSI model is not a
                    focus for the A+ exam).</li>
                <li>Examples of TCP-based applications:<ul>
                        <li><strong>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)</strong> for secure web browsing.</li>
                        <li><strong>SSH (Secure Shell)</strong> for secure terminal communication.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>UDP is a <strong>connectionless</strong> protocol, meaning it does not establish a formal connection
                    before sending data.</li>
                <li>Key features of UDP:<ul>
                        <li><strong>Unreliable delivery</strong>: No acknowledgments are sent, so there is no guarantee
                            that data will arrive intact or at all.</li>
                        <li><strong>No error recovery</strong>: Lost or corrupted data is not retransmitted.</li>
                        <li><strong>No flow control</strong>: The sender transmits data at its own pace without feedback
                            from the receiver.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low overhead</strong>: Faster and more efficient than TCP due to the lack of
                            connection setup and acknowledgment processes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Use cases for UDP:<ul>
                        <li><strong>Real-time applications</strong>, such as <strong>VoIP (Voice over IP)</strong> and
                            video streaming, where minor data loss is preferable to delays caused by retransmissions.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)</strong>: Used for automatic IP address
                            assignment.</li>
                        <li><strong>TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)</strong>: Used for simple, small file
                            transfers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Applications using UDP may implement their own error recovery or retransmission mechanisms if
                    needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Multiplexing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multiplexing</strong> allows multiple types of data to be transmitted simultaneously across
                    a network using <strong>TCP</strong> or <strong>UDP</strong>.</li>
                <li>Each type of traffic is assigned a unique <strong>port number</strong> to ensure it reaches the
                    correct application on the receiving device.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>IP Addresses and Port Numbers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IP Addresses</strong>: Unique identifiers assigned to each device on a network (similar to a
                    street address for a house).</li>
                <li><strong>Port Numbers</strong>: Used to direct data to the correct service or application on a device
                    (similar to rooms in a house).</li>
                <li>Port numbers range from <strong>0 to 65,535</strong> and are divided into two categories:<ul>
                        <li><strong>Non-ephemeral (permanent) ports</strong>: Typically range from <strong>0 to
                                1023</strong> and are assigned to well-known services (e.g., <strong>HTTP on port
                                80</strong>, <strong>HTTPS on port 443</strong>).</li>
                        <li><strong>Ephemeral (temporary) ports</strong>: Typically range from <strong>1024 to
                                65,535</strong> and are used by client devices for temporary communication sessions.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Port numbers are not a security mechanism but serve as a reference for directing traffic to the
                    correct application.</li>
                <li>Example of communication between a client and server:<ul>
                        <li>The client (IP: <code>10.0.0.1</code>) sends data to a server (IP: <code>10.0.0.2</code>)
                            using:<ul>
                                <li><strong>HTTP</strong> on <strong>TCP port 80</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>VoIP</strong> on <strong>UDP port 5004</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Email</strong> on <strong>TCP port 143</strong>.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The client uses a random <strong>ephemeral port</strong> for each communication session,
                            while the server uses a <strong>well-known port</strong> for its services.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
